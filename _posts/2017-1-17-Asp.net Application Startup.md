[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14986886/order-of-execution-of-the-absolute-earliest-places-to-run-code-in-asp-net](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14986886/order-of-execution-of-the-absolute-earliest-places-to-run-code-in-asp-net)

## Sequence of Start Up Events: ##
1. - Reading web.config
1. - Executing all methods marked with PreApplicationStartMethodAttribute
1. - Application start event: AutoEventWireup starts to work
1. - Executing all methods marked with PostApplicationStartMethodAttribute

## AutoEventWireup: ##
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2058621/difference-between-application-start-and-application-onstart](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2058621/difference-between-application-start-and-application-onstart "stackoverflow")
methods matching this pattern are searched: ModuleName_EventName, or ModuleName_OnEventName
AutoEventWireup: ModuleName_EventName, or ModuleName_OnEventName
e.g. Page_Load Application_Start

## Example Events: ##
- Application_OnStart: before first request, after startup
- Application_OnEnd: after last request, before shutdown
- Session_OnStart: before each unique user session, if without cookie, then for every request
- Session_OnEnd: before? user session expires

note: for multiple matches of the same event, the last one wins
for example if both Application_Start + Application_OnStart exist, Application_OnStart will be executed because it appears in the code later
